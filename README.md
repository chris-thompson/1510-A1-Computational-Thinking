It is customary to include a README.md file in your software projects.

A file with the extension .md is a markdown file.

You can read more about markdown here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

Note how PyCharm opens two windows for a markdown file. One window contains the raw source, and the other contains 
the rendered document.

Add your name and student number to the headers.

Add any additional information for me below. Make sure it is easy to read. Start applying what you are learning in 
COMM 1116 immediately.
